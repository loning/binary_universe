## Introduction

Binary Universe Theory (BUT) proposes that the essence of the universe can be completely described through binary sequences and XOR operations. This theory establishes a rigorous axiomatic system, unifying classical and quantum domains within an isomorphic binary state space, and explains entropy, observer, and self-reference mechanisms through a concise mathematical framework.

### Core Concepts

- All existence in the universe can be represented as binary sequences
- Universal evolution is uniquely determined through XOR operations
- Classical states and quantum states are essentially isomorphic
- Any state XORed with itself yields the absolute self-referential singularity
