## Introduction

Binary Universe Theory (BUT) proposes that the essence of the universe can be completely described through binary sequences and XOR operations. The theory establishes a rigorous axiom system that unifies classical and quantum domains within an isomorphic binary state space, and explains entropy, observers, and self-reference mechanisms through a concise mathematical framework.

### Core Concepts

- All existence in the universe can be represented as binary sequences
- Universe evolution is uniquely determined by XOR operations
- Classical and quantum states are isomorphic in essence
- Observers are not independent of the universe, but information patterns within it
- All physical laws can be derived from binary XOR recursion
- Any state XORed with itself results in an absolute self-reference singularity

## Document Structure

This project contains a rigorous formal description of Binary Universe Theory, as well as its correspondence with existing physical theories. The document system is based on core theory, gradually extending to applications and explanations in various fields of physics.
