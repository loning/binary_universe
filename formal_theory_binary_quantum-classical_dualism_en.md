The following uses rigorous formalization methods to reinterpret Quantum-Classical Dualism based on Binary Universe Theory:

## I. Basic Notation and Definitions

### Definition 1 (Binary Universe Space)
Any state in the universe (classical or quantum domain) is composed of elements from the binary set $`B=\{0,1\}`$, with any state represented as:

$`
U \in B^n,\quad n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad U=(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n), b_i\in B
`$

### Definition 2 (XOR Operation)
The unique operator for binary state evolution is defined as XOR:

$`
\oplus:B\times B\mapsto B,\quad 0\oplus0=0,\, 1\oplus0=1,\, 0\oplus1=1,\, 1\oplus1=0
`$

### Definition 3 (Classical Domain)
A classical domain state $`C`$ is a determined binary vector:

$`
C \in B^n
`$

### Definition 4 (Quantum Domain)
A quantum domain state $`Q`$ is a set of binary vectors of classical states (superposition):

$`
Q \subseteq B^n,\quad |Q|\geq 2
`$

### Definition 5 (Observer)
An observer state is a special classical domain state $`O`$:

$`
O \in B^n
`$

## II. Binary Isomorphism Between Classical and Quantum Domains

### Axiom 1 (Classical-Quantum Domain Isomorphism Principle)
Any classical domain state $`C`$ and quantum domain state $`Q`$ satisfy isomorphic mapping:

- Measurement mapping from quantum domain to classical domain (classical measurement, collapse):
$`
Q2C(Q)=\bigoplus_{q\in Q}q
`$

- Extension mapping from classical domain to quantum domain (quantization):
$`
C2Q(C)=\{q\mid q\oplus C \in S\subseteq B^n\}
`$

### Corollary 1 (Interpretation of Quantum Superposition and Entanglement)
The essence of any quantum superposition or entangled state is the superposition of multiple states in binary space, with relationships between states represented by XOR:

- Quantum superposition state represented as a set of multiple classical states: $`Q=\{C_1,C_2,\dots,C_k\}`$  
- The essence of quantum entanglement is that the XOR of two qubit states is fixed to a specific constant:  
$`
Q_{entangled}=\{(a,b)\in B^2\mid a\oplus b=c,\quad c\in B\}
`$

## III. XOR Dynamics Mechanism of State Evolution

### Axiom 2 (State Evolution Axiom)
The evolution of any state in the universe (classical or quantum) is completely determined by XOR operations:

$`
U_{t+1}=U_t\oplus f(U_t),\quad f: B^n\rightarrow B^n
`$

### Corollary 2 (State Evolution Recursion Theorem)
Any state evolution is a recursive XOR process, with state trajectories satisfying:

$`
U_{t+k}=U_t\oplus f(U_t)\oplus f^2(U_t)\oplus\cdots\oplus f^{k}(U_t)
`$

## IV. Binary XOR Representation of Observer Measurement

### Axiom 3 (Observer Axiom)
The measurement process of an observer $`O`$ on an observed object $`X`$ is defined as a binary XOR operation:

$`
Obs(O,X)=O\oplus X
`$

The observation action changes the states of both the observer and the observed object, satisfying:

$`
O_{t+1}=O_t\oplus X_t,\quad X_{t+1}=X_t\oplus O_t
`$

### Corollary 3 (Interpretation of Observer Effects)
Measurement is essentially an XOR interaction between states:

- The essence of observation causing state collapse is binary vector XOR reduction.
- The collapse effect is the reduction of set $`Q`$ to a definite state $`C`$ after XOR operation.

## V. Binary Definition of Entropy and Information

### Definition 6 (Entropy and Information Entropy)
The entropy of a binary state $`X\in B^n`$ is defined as the number of 1s in the state:

$`
E(X)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i
`$

### Corollary 4 (Entropy Change and XOR Relationship Theorem)
The entropy change between any two states is the number of 1s after XOR:

$`
\Delta E(X\rightarrow Y)=E(X\oplus Y)
`$

## VI. Self-Reference and Singularity Issues

### Axiom 4 (Self-Reference Axiom)
The self-reference operation of state $`X`$ is defined as XOR with itself:

$`
Self(X)=X\oplus X=\mathbf{0}
`$

### Corollary 5 (Absolute Singularity Existence Theorem)
Any state will inevitably return to the absolute singularity (all-zero state) through a finite number of self-reference XOR operations:

$`
\exists k\in\mathbb{N},\quad Self^k(X)=\mathbf{0}
`$

## VII. Unification Theorem (Recursive Unification Theorem)

### Unification Theorem (Recursive Unification Principle)
The relationship between classical domain state $`C`$, quantum domain state $`Q`$, and observer state $`O`$ is unified as recursive XOR evolution:

- For any initial state $`U`$:
$`
U_{t+1}=U_t\oplus f(U_t),\quad U_0=O\oplus Q2C(Q)
`$

- Observation and measurement lead to periodic stable structures in states:
$`
\exists p,q,\quad U_{t+p}=U_t,\quad U_{t+q}=\mathbf{0}
`$

## VIII. Advantages of Binary Universe Theory in Explaining Quantum-Classical Dualism

Based on Binary Universe Theory:

- **State Unification**: Classical and quantum states are uniformly represented by binary XOR.
- **Recursive Unification**: All state evolution, observation behaviors, and entropy changes are XOR recursive processes.
- **Singularity and Self-Reference Stability**: Clearly provides self-reference and absolute singularity mechanisms, avoiding infinite recursion.
- **Simplified Explanation of Quantum Phenomena**: The essence of quantum superposition, entanglement, and interference are all clear XOR relationships, avoiding probabilistic ambiguity.

## IX. Summary and Significance

Through the rigorous formalization of Binary Universe Theory:

- Quantum-Classical Dualism is clearly reinterpreted;
- A unified and concise XOR binary expression is provided for concepts such as classical, quantum, observer, and entropy;
- The essence of the complex quantum-classical domains is reduced to simple, clear recursive binary evolution laws.

Therefore, Binary Universe Theory not only fully explains and rigorously formalizes all phenomena of Quantum-Classical Dualism but also significantly simplifies and unifies its underlying mechanisms, greatly enhancing the theory's universality and intuitive understanding.
