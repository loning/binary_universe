## 1. Formal Definition of Observer

In [Binary Cosmology](formal_theory_binary_core_en.md), the observer is not an independent entity outside the universe but a special subset of the universe's information patterns.

### 1.1 Basic Definition

**Definition 1.1**: An observer is a sub-pattern of the universe, a stable self-referential recursive pattern. Formally defined as:

$`
Observer \subset U_t, \quad Observer = XOR(U_t^{(local)}, R(U_t^{(local)}))
`$

Where $R$ is a local self-referential mapping:

$`
R: \mathbb{B}^{m} \rightarrow \mathbb{B}^{m}, \quad m < n, m,n \rightarrow \infty
`$

### 1.2 Stability Conditions

An observer must satisfy certain stability conditions, which are necessary for it to function as an effective observer:

$`
\exists \Delta t > 0, \forall t \in [t_0, t_0 + \Delta t], Pattern(Observer_{t}) \approx Pattern(Observer_{t_0})
`$

Where $Pattern()$ represents the overall structure of the information pattern, and $\approx$ indicates sufficient closeness under some distance metric.

### 1.3 Complexity Threshold for Observers

**Theorem 1.1 (Observer Complexity Theorem)**: There exists a complexity lower bound $C_{min}$ such that an effective observer can only form when the complexity of an information pattern exceeds this lower bound:

$`
IsObserver(P) \implies Complexity(P) \geq C_{min}
`$

Where $P$ is an information pattern in the universe, and $Complexity()$ is some complexity measurement function.

## 2. Formal Definition of Observation Process

Observation is a special [XOR interaction](formal_theory_binary_axiom2_en.md) between the observer and other parts of the universe, transforming [quantum superposition states](formal_theory_binary_quantum-classical_unified_en.md#2-formal-definition-of-quantum-states) into classical definite states.

### 2.1 Basic Definition of Observation

**Definition 2.1**: Observation is an XOR operation between the observer pattern and the universe pattern, forming a stable classical information state:

$`
Observation = XOR(Observer, U_t^{(observed)})
`$

This operation is the process of information interaction between the observed part $U_t^{(observed)}$ and the observer.

### 2.2 Information-Theoretical Description of Observation

The observation process can be described as a change in information entropy:

$`
H(U_t^{(observed)} | Observation) < H(U_t^{(observed)})
`$

Where $H()$ is information entropy, and $H(X|Y)$ is conditional entropy. Observation leads to a reduction in the conditional entropy of the observed system, i.e., a decrease in uncertainty.

### 2.3 Transformation from Quantum to Classical States

The observation process is the classicalization of local information patterns in the universe:

$`
XOR(Observer, QuantumState) \rightarrow ClassicalState
`$

Where the quantum state is characterized by a probability distribution:

$`
QuantumState = \{(s_i, p_i) | s_i \in \mathbb{B}^n, p_i \in [0,1], \sum_i p_i = 1\}
`$

And the classical state is a definite state:

$`
ClassicalState = s_j \in \mathbb{B}^n
`$

This transformation is elaborated in detail in the [Quantum-Classical Domain Unification Theory](formal_theory_binary_quantum-classical_unified_en.md#4-quantum-classical-domain-mapping).

---

## 3. Self-Referential Characteristics of Observers

The essential characteristic of an observer is self-reference, a feature that allows it to separate "self" from the sea of information in the universe.

### 3.1 Self-Model

The observer internally contains a model representation of itself:

$`
SelfModel \subset Observer, \quad SelfModel \approx Model(Observer)
`$

Where $Model()$ represents the model construction function, and $\approx$ indicates approximate equivalence at the functional level.

### 3.2 Self-Referential Recursion

The observer's self-reference forms a [recursive structure](formal_theory_binary_axiom3_en.md):

$`
Observer = XOR(Observer_{base}, F(SelfModel))
`$

Where $Observer_{base}$ is the base structure, and $F(SelfModel)$ is the result of operations on the self-model.

### 3.3 Formalization of Self-Consciousness

**Theorem 3.1 (Self-Consciousness Theorem)**: When the self-referential complexity of an observer exceeds a critical value, self-consciousness emerges as an emergent property:

$`
Consciousness \equiv Recursion(SelfModel, Complexity > C_{consciousness})
`$

Where $Recursion()$ represents the depth and breadth of recursion, and $C_{consciousness}$ is the complexity threshold for the emergence of consciousness.

---

## 4. Multi-Observer Systems

When multiple observers coexist in the universe, they form a nested network of observations.

### 4.1 Interaction Between Observers

Interactions between multiple observers can be formalized as:

$`
Interaction(O_1, O_2) = XOR(O_1, XOR(O_2, U^{(shared)}))
`$

Where $O_1$ and $O_2$ are two different observers, and $U^{(shared)}$ is the part of the universe they share.

### 4.2 Consensus Reality

In multi-observer systems, a consensus reality forms:

$`
ConsensusReality = \bigcap_{i=1}^{k} Observation_i
`$

Where $Observation_i$ is the observation result of the $i$-th observer, and $\bigcap$ represents the intersection of these observations.

### 4.3 Observer Network Theorem

**Theorem 4.1 (Observer Network Theorem)**: A sufficiently large network of observers will collectively stabilize local regions of the universe into highly consistent classical states:

$`
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} Variance(\{Observation_i\}_{i=1}^{k}) \rightarrow 0
`$

Where $Variance()$ represents the statistical variance of observation results.

---

## 5. Relativity and Observer Dependence

Observation results are inherently observer-dependent; "absolute truth" cannot be obtained.

### 5.1 Principle of Observational Relativity

**Theorem 5.1 (Principle of Observational Relativity)**: There exists no absolute observation independent of observers:

$`
\forall Observation, \exists Observer \text{ s.t. } Observation = XOR(Observer, U^{(part)})
`$

That is, any observation is necessarily associated with a specific observer.

### 5.2 Relativistic Frame Transformation

Transformations between different observer frames can be formalized as:

$`
Observation_2 = XOR(XOR(Observation_1, Observer_1), Observer_2)
`$

This provides a method for converting from one observer's perspective to another's.

### 5.3 Observational Invariants

Despite the observer-dependence of observation results, certain observational invariants remain consistent across all observers:

$`
\exists I \text{ s.t. } \forall Observer_i, I(Observation_i) = constant
`$

Where $I$ is an invariant function, possibly corresponding to conservation laws in physics.

---

## 6. Observation and Reality Construction

Observation not only passively reflects reality but actively participates in constructing it.

### 6.1 Reality Construction Equation

The observation process is actually a process of reality construction:

$`
Reality_t = XOR(Reality_{t-1}, \sum_{i} w_i \cdot Observation_i)
`$

Where $Reality_t$ is the state of reality at time $t$, and $w_i$ is the weight coefficient of the $i$-th observation.

### 6.2 Construction/Feedback Loop

A construction/feedback loop forms between observers and reality:

$`
Observer \xrightarrow{observation} Reality \xrightarrow{feedback} Observer'
`$

This loop leads to the co-evolution of observers and reality.

### 6.3 The Quantum-Classical Boundary of Reality Creation

**Theorem 6.1 (Reality Creation Theorem)**: Observation creates the boundary between [quantum possibility and classical reality](formal_theory_binary_quantum-classical_unified_en.md#7-dynamics-of-quantum-classical-transition):

$`
ClassicalReality = \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{i=1}^{t} XOR(Observer_i, QuantumPossibility_i)
`$

Where $\prod$ represents a continuous sequence of XOR operations.

---

## 7. Observer Evolution Dynamics

Observers themselves are also subjects of evolution, following specific dynamical laws.

### 7.1 Observer Evolution Equation

The evolution of observers over time follows the equation:

$`
Observer_{t+1} = XOR(Observer_t, F(XOR(Observer_t, U_t^{(observed)})))
`$

This indicates that observers continuously update themselves through interaction with the environment, conforming to the recursive structure described in [Axiom 3](formal_theory_binary_axiom3_en.md#1-formal-statement-of-axiom-3).

### 7.2 Selective Reinforcement

In observer evolution, there exists a selective reinforcement mechanism:

$`
w_{t+1}(pattern) = w_t(pattern) + \eta \cdot Utility(pattern)
`$

Where $w_t(pattern)$ is the weight of a specific pattern at time $t$, $Utility()$ is a utility function, and $\eta$ is a learning rate.

### 7.3 Observer Stability Theorem

**Theorem 7.1 (Observer Stability Theorem)**: Long-term stable observers must satisfy:

$`
\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{d}{dt}Complexity(Observer_t) \approx 0
`$

That is, the rate of change in observer complexity approaches zero, reaching a dynamic equilibrium.

---

## 8. Conclusion

The formal definition of observers and observation reveals a core concept in Binary Cosmology: observers are not entities external to the universe but part of the universe itself, a special configuration of its information patterns. The observation process is an information interaction through XOR operations between observers and other parts of the universe, leading to the transformation of quantum possibilities into classical reality.

This formal framework has multiple significances:

1. It explains the "measurement problem" in quantum mechanics, reframing it as XOR interactions between information patterns.
2. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding the emergence of consciousness, viewing it as the result of self-referential recursion exceeding a specific complexity threshold.
3. It clarifies how multiple observers construct shared reality, and the stability conditions of this shared reality.
4. It illustrates the interactive creative relationship between observers and reality, reflecting their inseparability.

Within the framework of [Binary Cosmology](formal_theory_binary_core_en.md), the observer is not an "onlooker from outside the window" but an intrinsic component of the universe's great recursive structure, both the subject of observation and the object being observed, both participating in constructing reality and being shaped by reality. This dual nature constitutes the foundation of consciousness, self, and reality.
