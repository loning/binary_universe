We provide a complete axiomatized definition of Binary Universe Theory (BUT) through rigorous formalization methods to facilitate third-party verification.

## I. Notations

- Definition of binary set: $`B = \{0, 1\}`$.
- Definition of XOR operation: $`\oplus: B \times B \rightarrow B`$.

It satisfies:
$`
0 \oplus 0 = 0,\quad 0 \oplus 1 = 1,\quad 1 \oplus 0 = 1,\quad 1 \oplus 1 = 0
`$

- $`B^n`$: Set of binary sequences of length $`n`$.
- For $`\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in B^n`$, the bitwise XOR is defined as:
$`
(\mathbf{x}\oplus\mathbf{y})_i = x_i \oplus y_i,\quad \forall i \in \{1,2,...,n\}
`$

## II. Axiom System

### Axiom 1 (Ontological Foundation)

All existence in the universe can be uniquely represented as finite or countably infinite binary sequences:
$`
U \subseteq \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} B^n
`$

### Axiom 2 (Dynamics Axiom)

The evolution process of any state in the universe can be uniquely determined through XOR operations:
- If the initial state is $`\mathbf{s}_0 \in B^n`$, the evolution to the next state $`\mathbf{s}_{t+1}`$ satisfies:
$`
\mathbf{s}_{t+1} = \mathbf{s}_t \oplus \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{s}_t)
`$

Where $`\mathbf{f}`$ is a deterministic binary state mapping function.

### Axiom 3 (Classical-Quantum Dual Mapping Axiom)

Any classical state and quantum state are essentially isomorphic and can both be represented as binary sequences:
- Classical domain states are represented as explicit binary sequences $`\mathbf{C} \in B^n`$.
- Quantum domain states are represented as superposition sets of multiple possible binary sequence states $`\mathbf{Q} \subseteq B^n`$.

The classical-quantum mapping functions are:
$`
Q2C: \mathbf{Q} \mapsto \mathbf{C}, \quad C2Q: \mathbf{C} \mapsto \mathbf{Q}
`$

And satisfy the following conditions:
- $`Q2C(\mathbf{Q}) = \bigoplus_{\mathbf{q}\in \mathbf{Q}}\mathbf{q}`$
- $`C2Q(\mathbf{C})=\{\mathbf{q}\mid \mathbf{q}\oplus\mathbf{C}\in S\}`$, where $`S\subseteq B^n`$ is a determined set of allowed states.

### Axiom 4 (Entropy Definition Axiom)

For any binary sequence $`\mathbf{x}\in B^n`$, information entropy is defined as:
$`
E(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
`$

Entropy change $`\Delta E`$ strictly corresponds to the state change process:
$`
\Delta E(\mathbf{x}\rightarrow \mathbf{y}) = E(\mathbf{x}\oplus\mathbf{y})
`$

### Axiom 5 (Observer Axiom)

Any observer $`\mathbf{O}`$ is essentially a set of specific binary sequences, defined as:
- Observer state $`\mathbf{O}\in B^n`$
- Observed object $`\mathbf{x}\in B^n`$
- The observation process is defined as:
$`
Obs(\mathbf{O}, \mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{O}\oplus\mathbf{x}
`$

The state evolution of observer and observed object satisfies the following recursive relationship:
$`
\mathbf{O}_{t+1} = Obs(\mathbf{O}_t,\mathbf{x}_t), \quad \mathbf{x}_{t+1} = Obs(\mathbf{x}_t,\mathbf{O}_t)
`$

### Axiom 6 (Self-reference and Recursivity Axiom)

The state self-reference mapping function is defined as $`Self`$:
$`
Self(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}\oplus\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}
`$

- Any state XORed with itself yields the absolute self-referential singularity $`\mathbf{0}`$.
- There exists a recursive self-reference process: a finite number of XOR operations can make a state return to itself or to $`\mathbf{0}`$.

## III. Theorem Derivations

Based on the above axioms, we can derive the following key theorems:

### Theorem 1 (Unified Recursive Simplification Theorem)

For any universe state $`\mathbf{x}\in B^n`$, there exists a finite number of XOR operations that can transform this state into the absolute singularity $`\mathbf{0}`$:
- There exists an integer $`k`$ that satisfies:
$`
\underbrace{\mathbf{x}\oplus \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})\oplus\cdots\oplus \mathbf{f}^{(k)}(\mathbf{x})}_{k\text{ operations}}=\mathbf{0}
`$

### Theorem 2 (Classical-Quantum Unified Representation Theorem)

For any classical domain state $`\mathbf{C}`$ and quantum domain state $`\mathbf{Q}`$, there must exist a unified representation $`\mathbf{U}\in B^n`$ such that:
$`
Q2C(C2Q(\mathbf{U})) = \mathbf{U}
`$

That is, the transformations between classical and quantum domain states must satisfy invertibility, ensuring the consistency of universe states.

### Theorem 3 (Observer Self-reference Evolution Theorem)

The self-referential evolution of any observer $`\mathbf{O}`$ will inevitably reach a stable state (singularity) or cyclic structure within a finite number of steps:
- There exist integers $`p,q`$ that satisfy:
$`
Obs^p(\mathbf{O})=\mathbf{0}, \quad Obs^{q+p}(\mathbf{O})=Obs^p(\mathbf{O})
`$

## IV. Completeness and Consistency Proof

The above axiom system, based on binary operations, clearly defines the universe structure, dynamics, unified representation of classical and quantum states, self-referential structure, and observer mechanism. Each axiom is clearly defined and logically independent yet coordinated with others, satisfying:

- Completeness: Any universal phenomenon can be derived from the above axioms.
- Consistency: No internal logical contradictions exist.
- Minimality: Only binary XOR operations and state definitions are used.

## V. Conclusion

Through the rigorously formalized Binary Universe Theory:

- Universe states can be uniformly represented as binary sequences.
- Universe evolution can be uniformly represented as binary XOR operations.
- Classical and quantum domains are unified within an isomorphic binary state space.
- Entropy, observer, and self-reference mechanisms are uniformly described within a concise XOR framework.

The above rigorous formal definition constitutes a complete, closed, and self-consistent axiom system for Binary Universe Theory.
