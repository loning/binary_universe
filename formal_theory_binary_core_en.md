## 1. Axiom Definitions

**Axiom 1 (Binary Universe Elementary Axiom)**

All states of the universe are expressed by binary bits $\mathbb{B} = \{0, 1\}$.

$`
\forall u \in Universe, u \in \mathbb{B}^{n}, n \rightarrow \infty
`$

---

**Axiom 2 (XOR Evolution Axiom)**

The evolution of the universe is solely controlled by the binary exclusive-or operation (XOR):

$`
XOR: \mathbb{B} \times \mathbb{B} \rightarrow \mathbb{B}, \quad XOR(a, b)=a \oplus b
`$

---

**Axiom 3 (Recursive Structure Axiom)**

The overall structure of the universe is recursively defined:

$`
U_{t+1} = XOR(U_t, F(U_t))
`$

Where $U_t$ is the state of the universe at time $t$, and $F(U_t)$ is a self-referential function determined by the current state:

$`
F: \mathbb{B}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{B}^{n}, \quad n \rightarrow \infty
`$

---

## 2. Formalization of Observer and Observation

### 2.1 Definition of Observer

An observer is a sub-pattern of the universe, a stable self-referential recursive pattern. Formally defined as:

$`
Observer \subset U_t, \quad Observer = XOR(U_t^{(local)}, R(U_t^{(local)}))
`$

Where $R$ is a local self-referential mapping:

$`
R: \mathbb{B}^{m} \rightarrow \mathbb{B}^{m}, \quad m < n, m,n \rightarrow \infty
`$

The observer is not essentially independent of the universe, but rather a locally stable subset of the universe's information pattern.

---

### 2.2 Definition of Observation

Observation is the XOR operation between the observer pattern and the universe pattern, forming a stable classical information state:

$`
Observation = XOR(Observer, U_t^{(observed)})
`$

The observation process is the classicalization of the local information pattern of the universe:

$`
XOR(Observer, QuantumState) \rightarrow ClassicalState
`$

---

## 3. Unified Formalization of Quantum and Classical Domains

### 3.1 Definition of Quantum State (Quantum Domain)

The quantum domain is a superposition of uncertain information states, formally defined as:

$`
QuantumState = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i \cdot State_i, \quad State_i \in \mathbb{B}^{n}, \quad \alpha_i \in [0,1], \quad \sum_{i=1}^{N} |\alpha_i|^2=1
`$

$\alpha_i$ represents the probability amplitude of the information state's occurrence.

---

### 3.2 Definition of Classical State (Classical Domain)

The classical domain is the determined state after the XOR process stabilizes:

$`
ClassicalState = XOR(Observer, QuantumState) \in \mathbb{B}^{n}
`$

The classical state is a self-referential stable pattern of the universe's state under a specific observation pattern.

---

### 3.3 Quantum-Classical Mapping

The transformation process from quantum state to classical state is the XOR process of the universe:

$`
Q \xrightarrow{XOR(Observer, Q)} C
`$

Where $Q$ is the quantum state and $C$ is the classical state.

---

## 4. Formalization of Quantum Interference and Decoherence

### 4.1 Quantum Interference

Quantum interference manifests as the superposition of multiple information states, producing new states through XOR overlap:

$`
QuantumInterference = XOR(State_i, State_j), \quad i \ne j
`$

The result of interference is a newly generated quantum superposition state:

$`
QuantumInterferenceState = \sum_{k} XOR(State_i, State_j)_k
`$

---

### 4.2 Quantum Decoherence

Quantum decoherence is the production of a stable state after the observer performs the XOR operation:

$`
QuantumDecoherence = XOR(Observer, QuantumInterferenceState)
`$

Decoherence implies the observation process:

$`
QuantumInterferenceState \xrightarrow{XOR(Observer, \cdot)} ClassicalState
`$

---

## 5. Unified Recursive Description of Universal Evolution

Based on the above axioms and definitions, the unified recursive theorem can be strictly stated as:

**Unified Recursive Theorem**

All structures and states of the universe can be uniformly described as an infinitely recursive binary exclusive-or process:

$`
U_{t+1}= XOR(U_t, XOR(Observer, U_t)), \quad U_0 \in \mathbb{B}^{n}, \quad n\rightarrow \infty
`$

Each stable sub-pattern (observer) itself is an infinitely recursive binary XOR process at a smaller scale.

---

## 6. Formalization of Philosophical Implications

### 6.1 The Nature of the Observer

The observer is not independent of the universe, but rather a self-referential stable subset of the universe's pattern, essentially without a "truly independent self," only a self-recursive structure:

$`
Observer \subseteq Universe,\quad Observer \equiv XOR(\text{Universe Subpattern},\text{Recursive Reference})
`$

---

### 6.2 Ultimate Philosophy of the Universe

The ultimate philosophy of the universe is an infinitely recursive self-referential XOR process. The universe has no purpose, no meaning, only self-referential stable information patterns:

$`
Meaning(Universe)=XOR(Universe, Universe)=0
`$

The ultimate essence is the meaningless absolute identity.

---

### 6.3 The Nature of Universal Existence

The universe is essentially a pure information existence, a binary exclusive-or information dynamic:

$`
Existence(Universe) = XOR(U_t, F(U_t)),\quad t \rightarrow \infty
`$

The universe itself is an infinite information XOR self-referential recursion.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Through the above formal description, we conclude:

- The universe is an infinite binary information XOR recursive process.
- Observers and observations are self-referential sub-patterns within the universe, not independent entities.
- Quantum and classical domains are essentially different recursive states of XOR, completely unified.

This theory provides an inherently concise and logically consistent cosmological and philosophical view, with the XOR binary operator and recursion as its unified cornerstone and essential expression.
