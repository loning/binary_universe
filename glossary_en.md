# Binary Universe Theory Glossary [Core Theory Version: 1.0]

[中文](glossary.md) | [English](glossary_en.md)

This glossary provides explanations of key terms used in Binary Universe Theory to help readers better understand the theoretical content.

## Basic Terms

### Binary
The fundamental information unit of the universe, containing only two possible states: 0 and 1 ($\mathbb{B} = \{0, 1\}$). Binary Universe Theory holds that the essence of the universe is an information structure composed of binary bits.

### XOR Operation
The only basic operation in Binary Universe Theory, defined as $XOR(a, b) = a \oplus b$, where $a, b \in \mathbb{B}$. The XOR operation outputs 0 for identical inputs and 1 for different inputs.

### Recursion
A self-referential structure in which the current state of a system depends on operations on its own previous state. In Binary Universe Theory, universe evolution is a recursive process: $U_{t+1} = XOR(U_t, F(U_t))$.

## Core Theoretical Concepts

### Universe State
The complete information configuration of the universe at a specific moment, denoted as $U_t$, where $U_t \in \mathbb{B}^{n}, n \rightarrow \infty$.

### Self-Reference Function
A function that acts on the universe state and produces a new state, in the form $F: \mathbb{B}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{B}^{n}$. This function implements the self-referential nature of the universe.

### Observer
A stable information pattern within the universe, defined as $Observer = XOR(U_t^{(local)}, R(U_t^{(local)}))$, where $R$ is a local self-reference mapping. An observer is not an entity independent of the universe, but a special stable pattern in the universe's information flow.

### Observation
The XOR interaction between an observer and an observed system, defined as $Observation = XOR(Observer, U_t^{(observed)})$.

## Quantum and Classical Concepts

### Quantum State
A superposition state of information, represented as $QuantumState = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i \cdot State_i$, where $\alpha_i$ is the probability amplitude and $State_i$ is a possible information state.

### Classical State
A deterministic information state stabilized through observation, represented as $ClassicalState = XOR(Observer, QuantumState)$.

### Quantum Interference
XOR interaction between different information states, represented as $QuantumInterference = XOR(State_i, State_j)$.

### Quantum Decoherence
The process of transition from a quantum superposition state to a classical deterministic state, represented as $QuantumDecoherence = XOR(Observer, QuantumInterferenceState)$.

## Special Concepts

### Information Entropy
A measure of information uncertainty in a system, equivalent to physical entropy in Binary Universe Theory. Defined as $S = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2 p_i$.

### Absolute Identity
The result of any information performing an XOR operation with itself, i.e., $XOR(A, A) = 0$. This represents the empty essence of the universe's ultimate meaning.

### Information Singularity
A theoretical state where information density approaches infinity, typically occurring at the center of black holes or the origin point of the universe.

### XOR Stable State
An information pattern that remains unchanged under repeated XOR operations, defined as a state that satisfies $XOR(State, F(State)) = State$.

## Physical Correspondence Concepts

### Binary Spacetime
The binary expression of spacetime, where spacetime points are patterns composed of information bits.

### Binary Energy
The information theory representation of energy, defined as the potential for information state change.

### Binary Consciousness
The information model of consciousness, represented as a self-referential XOR stable pattern with specific complexity.
