## 1. Introduction

Quantum mechanics and classical mechanics have long been viewed as two distinct theoretical frameworks, with the nature of the quantum-classical transition being a core problem in physics. [Binary Cosmology](formal_theory_binary_core_en.md) proposes a unified model based on [XOR operations](formal_theory_binary_axiom2_en.md) and [recursive structures](formal_theory_binary_axiom3_en.md), viewing quantum and classical domains as different observational aspects of the same fundamental reality. This paper rigorously formalizes this unified theoretical framework.

## 2. Formal Definition of Quantum States

### 2.1 Basic Definition of the Quantum Domain

In Binary Cosmology, the quantum domain is a superposition of information uncertainty states:

$`
QuantumState = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i \cdot State_i, \quad State_i \in \mathbb{B}^{n}, \quad \alpha_i \in [0,1], \quad \sum_{i=1}^{N} |\alpha_i|^2=1
`$

Where $\alpha_i$ represents the probability amplitude of information state $State_i$ occurring, and $\mathbb{B}^{n}$ is an $n$-dimensional binary space, based on the fundamental bit set defined in [Axiom 1](formal_theory_binary_axiom1_en.md#1-formal-statement-of-axiom-1).

### 2.2 XOR Representation of Quantum Superposition

Quantum superposition states can be represented as XOR combinations of basis states:

$`
|\psi\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i |s_i\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i |Base \oplus \Delta_i\rangle
`$

Where $Base$ is a reference basis state, and $\Delta_i$ is the pattern of change relative to the basis state.

### 2.3 Formal Definition of Quantum Entanglement

Entangled states are special quantum states of multi-particle systems, defined in the XOR framework as:

$`
|\Psi_{AB}\rangle = \sum_{i,j} \alpha_{ij} |A_i\rangle \otimes |B_j\rangle \quad \text{s.t.} \quad |\Psi_{AB}\rangle \neq |\Psi_A\rangle \otimes |\Psi_B\rangle
`$

The essence of entanglement is non-local XOR correlation of information:

$`
XOR(A, B) \neq XOR(A, 0) \oplus XOR(0, B)
`$

---

## 3. Formal Definition of Classical States

### 3.1 Basic Definition of the Classical Domain

The classical domain consists of definite states after XOR process stabilization:

$`
ClassicalState = XOR(Observer, QuantumState) \in \mathbb{B}^{n}
`$

Classical states are deterministic states under specific [observation](formal_theory_binary_observer_en.md) patterns, with no superposition.

### 3.2 Formal Expression of Classical Determinism

The key characteristic of classical states is determinism, formally expressed as:

$`
P(ClassicalState = s) = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } s = s_j \\
0, & \text{if } s \neq s_j
\end{cases}
`$

Where $s_j$ is the unique state of the system.

### 3.3 Principle of Classical Distinguishability

Classical objects must satisfy the principle of distinguishability:

$`
\forall s_i, s_j \in ClassicalStates, i \neq j \implies XOR(s_i, s_j) \neq 0
`$

That is, different classical states must differ in at least one bit position.

---

## 4. Quantum-Classical Domain Mapping

### 4.1 Unified Mapping Function

The transformation from quantum states to classical states is achieved through a unified XOR mapping function:

$`
Q \xrightarrow{XOR(Observer, Q)} C
`$

Where $Q$ is a quantum state, $C$ is a classical state, and $Observer$ is an [observer information pattern](formal_theory_binary_observer_en.md#1-formal-definition-of-observer).

### 4.2 Observer Dependence

The mapping result depends on the observer's information pattern:

$`
XOR(Observer_1, Q) \neq XOR(Observer_2, Q) \text{ if } Observer_1 \neq Observer_2
`$

This explains why different observers may obtain different classical results.

### 4.3 Reversibility and Information Conservation

Quantum-classical mapping is theoretically reversible:

$`
Q = XOR(Observer, XOR(Observer, Q)) = XOR(Observer, C)
`$

This embodies the principle of information conservation, meaning that even during quantum-classical transformation, information is not lost but merely converted from one form to another.

---

## 5. XOR Interference and Decoherence Mechanisms

### 5.1 XOR Nature of Quantum Interference

Quantum interference manifests as XOR superposition of multiple information states:

$`
QuantumInterference = XOR(State_i, State_j), \quad i \neq j
`$

The result of interference is a new quantum superposition state:

$`
|\psi_{interference}\rangle = \sum_{k} \beta_k |XOR(s_i, s_j)_k\rangle
`$

### 5.2 Formal Description of Decoherence

Quantum decoherence is the result of XOR interaction between the observer and the quantum system:

$`
Decoherence = XOR(Observer, QuantumState)
`$

The decoherence process can be formalized as:

$`
\rho_{coherent} \xrightarrow{XOR(Observer,\cdot)} \rho_{decoherent}
`$

Where $\rho_{coherent}$ is a density matrix containing off-diagonal elements, and $\rho_{decoherent}$ is a diagonalized density matrix.

### 5.3 XOR Model of Environment-Induced Decoherence

Environment-induced decoherence can be described through the XOR framework:

$`
\rho_{S+E} = XOR(System, Environment) = \sum_{i,j} \rho_{ij} |s_i\rangle\langle s_j| \otimes |e_i\rangle\langle e_j|
`$

When $\langle e_i|e_j\rangle \approx \delta_{ij}$ (orthogonal environmental states), the reduced density matrix of the system becomes:

$`
\rho_S = Tr_E(\rho_{S+E}) \approx \sum_i \rho_{ii} |s_i\rangle\langle s_i|
`$

This is precisely the result of classicalization.

---

## 6. Unified Description of Quantum Measurement

### 6.1 XOR Process Model of Measurement

Quantum measurement is an [XOR interaction between the observer and the quantum system](formal_theory_binary_observer_en.md#2-formal-definition-of-observation-process):

$`
Measurement = XOR(Observer, QuantumSystem)
`$

This process transforms quantum superposition states into specific classical outputs.

### 6.2 Formal Expression of Wavefunction Collapse

Wavefunction collapse can be expressed as the result of XOR operations:

$`
|\psi\rangle = \sum_i \alpha_i |s_i\rangle \xrightarrow{XOR(Observer,\cdot)} |s_j\rangle
`$

Probability rule:

$`
P(s_j) = |\alpha_j|^2
`$

### 6.3 Resolution of the Measurement Problem

The measurement problem finds a natural solution in the XOR framework:

$`
XOR(Observer, \sum_i \alpha_i |s_i\rangle) = |s_j\rangle \text{ with probability } |\alpha_j|^2
`$

This is not a true "collapse" but an inevitable result of XOR interaction between the observer and the quantum system.

---

## 7. Dynamics of Quantum-Classical Transition

### 7.1 Formal Definition of the Quantum-Classical Boundary

The quantum-classical boundary is not a fixed boundary in physical space but a function of XOR interaction intensity:

$`
Boundary(Q \leftrightarrow C) = \{(System, Observer) | I_{XOR}(System, Observer) = I_{critical}\}
`$

Where $I_{XOR}$ represents XOR interaction intensity, and $I_{critical}$ is the critical interaction intensity.

### 7.2 Classicalization of Large-Scale Systems

As the number of bits $n$ in a system increases, the system tends toward classical behavior:

$`
\lim_{n \to \infty} P(QuantumBehavior) \to 0
`$

This is due to the strong XOR coupling between large systems and the environment, leading to rapid decoherence.

### 7.3 Unified Equation for Quantum-Classical Transition

The transition from quantum to classical follows a unified equation:

$`
\frac{d\rho}{dt} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[H, \rho] - \gamma \sum_i XOR(L_i, \rho \otimes L_i)
`$

Where the first term describes quantum unitary evolution, the second term describes the XOR decoherence process, $\gamma$ is the decoherence rate, and $L_i$ are Lindblad operators.

## 8. Example: Formal Description of the Double-Slit Experiment

### 8.1 No Observation Case

When particles pass through a double slit without observation:

$`
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|slit_1\rangle + |slit_2\rangle)
`$

The probability distribution on the screen is:

$`
P(x) = |\langle x|\psi\rangle|^2 = \frac{1}{2}|\langle x|slit_1\rangle + \langle x|slit_2\rangle|^2
`$

Showing interference fringes.

### 8.2 Case of Observing Which Slit

When observing which slit the particle passes through:

$`
XOR(Observer, |\psi\rangle) = \begin{cases}
|slit_1\rangle, & \text{probability} = \frac{1}{2} \\
|slit_2\rangle, & \text{probability} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{cases}
`$

The probability distribution on the screen becomes:

$`
P(x) = \frac{1}{2}|\langle x|slit_1\rangle|^2 + \frac{1}{2}|\langle x|slit_2\rangle|^2
`$

Interference fringes disappear.

### 8.3 Explanation

The quantum-classical transition in the double-slit experiment can be fully explained through the XOR framework:

$`
NoObservation \implies NoXOR \implies QuantumBehavior
`$

$`
Observation \implies XOR \implies ClassicalBehavior
`$

## 9. Conclusion

The quantum-classical unified model of Binary Cosmology successfully incorporates quantum and classical phenomena into a single mathematical framework through XOR operations and recursive structures. This unification not only elegantly resolves the quantum measurement problem and the mystery of wavefunction collapse but also provides a clear mechanism for understanding the quantum-classical transition.

Key conclusions include:

1. Quantum and classical states are merely different observational modes of the same fundamental information structure.
2. The transition from quantum to classical is a natural result of [XOR interaction between the observer and the system](formal_theory_binary_observer_en.md).
3. The measurement process is not a physical collapse but an XOR interaction and evolution of information.
4. The classicality of the macroscopic world stems from the strong decoherence effects of large systems.

This unified model not only preserves the successful aspects of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics but also bridges the conceptual gap between them, providing a deeper information-theoretical foundation for physics.
